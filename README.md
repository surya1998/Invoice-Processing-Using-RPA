## ABSTRACT:
Invoice processing is the entire process your company's accounts payable uses to handle supplier invoices. It starts when you receive an invoice and finishes when payment has been made and recorded in the general ledger. You can receive paper invoices, PDF, or other electronic means. Invoice processing consist of several data which are of different formats. The data gets analyzed and it is stored in the respective folder accordingly. The data that is stored is in a pdf file and we have to convert that to the excel file. 

## PROPOSED SYSTEM:
The invoice system is used to overcome the entire problem which they are facing currently, and making complete automation of billing and invoice system.The first step of the process consists out of the selection of the right PDF invoice in a dedicated folder.For the RPA bot, it does not matter which application is used to process the invoice data. This can be any kind of accounting. And next step reading the invoice form the folder one by one and extracting the key information from the invoice data.After successfully registering the each invoice, the software robots are then able to send posting notifications in the form of emails to responsible employees.Other background activities, During this whole process the software robots are also running background activities such as monitoring the dedicated invoice folder or its email address, performing basic checks to see is company's database is open and verifying by the vendor information. And the invoice matches what is already in the database. Due to the automation process the time complexity gets reduced and the chances of occurence of errors are very low.
